## What is R Programming?
R is an open source programming language that was built for statistical computing. It excels at data analysis, has built in graphics support, and it interacts well with tabular data structures.  

R is a tool of choice for data miners, data analysts, and data scientists. The rise of R has followed the rise of data science in enterprise; according to the TIOBE index, a measure of the popularity of programming languages, R has seen an explosion in usage since 2014. It is now one of the most popular programming languages in the world when it comes to data science and machine learning.

## Benefits of R
+ **Dataset friendly**  

  One of Râ€™s greatest strengths is that it greatly improves efficiency and development time, as you do not have to formulate loops as often as in other programming languages. You can call a mean() or a sum function, for example, on the entirety of a column of a dataset without having to build a nested loop.
+ **Easy to learn**  

  R feels very natural for someone used to Excel or SQL, as it treats data as rows and columns rather than individual variables or data structures to be looped over. Being a higher-level programming language like Python or JavaScript, R is also easy to pick up, with many of the more mundane tasks being abstracted away, like garbage collection, variable typing, formulating many loops, or handling many exemptions. 
+ **Large community**  
  
  For an open source technology to become useful, it must have a large community that helps improve and make the technology better. R has gained enough of a following to receive a critical mass for an open source technology. Thus, practitioners of R will have the benefit a well-hydrated support community such as StackOverflow and other public forums. R also has more than ten thousand free and open source packages on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), the community that curates and distributes R packages. The number of R packages on CRAN have risen exponentially over the years.
